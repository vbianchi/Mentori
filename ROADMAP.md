# ResearchAgent: Project Roadmap (v2.5.3 Target Base)

This document outlines the planned development path for the ResearchAgent project. [cite: 99] It is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves. [cite: 99]
## Guiding Principles for Development

-   Accuracy & Reliability Over Speed [cite: 100]
-   User-in-the-Loop (UITL/HITL) [cite: 100]
-   Modularity & Maintainability [cite: 100]
-   Extensibility [cite: 100]

## Phase 1: Core Stability & Foundational Tools (Largely Complete - Basis of v2.5.2)

-   UI Framework: Three-panel layout. [cite: 101]
-   Backend Infrastructure: Python, WebSockets, `aiohttp`. [cite: 101]
-   Task Management: Persistent storage, UI updates. [cite: 102]
-   Core Agent Flow (P-C-E-E Pipeline). [cite: 102]
-   Core Tools Implemented & Refined. [cite: 103]
-   LLM Configuration. [cite: 103]
-   Frontend & Backend Refactoring. [cite: 104]
-   Backend Plan Proposal Mechanism. [cite: 104]
## Phase 2: Enhanced Agent Capabilities & User Experience (Current & Near-Term Focus - Targeting v2.5.3)

1.  Core Agent Execution Stability & Feature Verification (Improved)
    -   `deep_research_synthesizer` & `write_file` Flow: Actual execution logic in place. [cite: 105]
    -   `UnboundLocalError` in `callbacks.py`: **FIXED.** [cite: 105]
2.  Refine Chat UI/UX & Message Flow (Largely Implemented - Minor Debugging Ongoing)
    -   **Visual Design Goal (Achieved):** Implemented the chat interface as per `simulation_option6.html` (unified blue outer lines, no line on major steps, nested/indented component-specific lines for sub-statuses & thoughts, user message right line, persistent bottom thinking line). [cite: 106] HTML tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`) now render correctly. [cite: 106]
    -   **Persistence (Implemented):** All new message structures (major steps, sub-statuses, thoughts) are saved to and reloaded from the database. [cite: 107]
    -   **Current Bugs & Next Steps for Chat UI/UX:**
        -   **FIXED: Token Counter Per Agent:** UI token counter now updates correctly with tokens generated by each individual agent (INTENT CLASSIFIER, PLANNER, CONTROLLER, EXECUTOR, EVALUATOR). [cite: 107]
        -   **FIX (Medium Priority): Artifact Viewer Refresh:** Ensure reliable auto-update after task completion. [cite: 108]
        -   **FIX (Low Priority): Plan File Status Update:** Correct regex for updating checkboxes in `_plan_{id}.md`. [cite: 109]
        -   **REVIEW (Low Priority): "Unknown" History Message Types:** Confirm monitor log is the correct destination. [cite: 110]
3.  BUG FIX (Previously Medium Priority - Now covered by specific items above): Chat Input Unresponsive. [cite: 111] (Likely related to New Task Connection/Agent State). [cite: 112]
4.  DEBUG (Previously Medium Priority - Now Low): Monitor Log Color-Coding. [cite: 112]
    -   Goal: Visually differentiate Monitor Log messages by source. [cite: 113]
    -   PENDING/DEBUG: CSS rules in `style.css` need to be created/verified. [cite: 114]
## Phase 3: Advanced Interactivity & Tooling (Mid-Term)

(No changes to this section's general goals yet)

-   Advanced User-in-the-Loop (UITL/HITL) Capabilities. [cite: 116]
-   New Tools & Tool Enhancements. [cite: 116]
-   Workspace RAG. [cite: 117]
-   Improved Agent Memory & Context Management. [cite: 117]

## Phase 4: Advanced Agent Autonomy & Specialized Applications (Longer-Term)

(No changes to this section's general goals yet)

-   Advanced Re-planning & Self-Correction. [cite: 118]
-   User Permissions & Resource Gateway. [cite: 118]
-   Streaming Output. [cite: 119]
-   Specialized Agent Personas & Workflows. [cite: 119]
-   Collaborative Features. [cite: 119]

This roadmap will guide our development efforts. [cite: 120] Feedback and adjustments are welcome. [cite: 120]
