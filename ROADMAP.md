### Project Vision:

To build a transformative, AI-powered workbench. The platform will be powerful enough for scientific research and general enough for power users, with a core architecture that allows users to easily add their own tools and capabilities. The system is designed for privacy and efficiency, with a clear path to running on local LLMs.

### âœ… COMPLETED PHASES

-   \[x\] **Phase 0-16:** Core Engine, Advanced Tooling, & UI Foundation. This includes the three-track architecture, self-correction, interactive GUI, Memory Vault, and secure virtual environments.

### ðŸš€ UPCOMING PHASES ðŸš€

#### Phase 17: The Autonomous Board of Experts & Company Model

_Goal: Implement the full, two-part agent architecture where the Board of Experts acts as an autonomous strategic planner and the Company Model acts as a resilient execution engine, communicating the entire process through a clear, chronological UI narrative._

-   \[x\] **Task 1 (Part 1): Initial User Authorization - Board Approval.**
    -   Implemented the `Propose_Experts` node to dynamically generate expert personas.
    -   Implemented the first user interrupt, where the UI displays the proposed board and waits for the user's **"Approve"** action.
-   \[ \] **Task 1 (Part 2): Initial User Authorization - Plan Approval.**
    -   Implement the second user interrupt, which occurs after the autonomous planning phase is complete. The UI will display the final, synthesized plan and wait for a final **"Approve & Execute"** action.
-   \[ \] **Task 2: Autonomous Sequential Plan Refinement.**
    -   Implement the full, uninterrupted planning loop that runs after the user approves the board.
    -   `Chair_Initial_Plan` node creates a strategic plan. **(Partially complete)**
    -   Implement the `Expert_Critique` node to be called sequentially for each expert, generating critiques and programmatic plan modifications.
    -   Implement the `Chair_Final_Review` node to synthesize all critiques into a final plan for the second user authorization gate.
-   \[ \] **Task 3: Resilient Execution & Self-Correction Loop.**
    -   Implement the full "Company Model" execution loop (`Foreman`, `Supervisor`, `Worker`).
    -   Implement retry logic before escalating a failed step.
-   \[ \] **Task 4: Autonomous Checkpoint Review Cycle.**
    -   Implement the internal review process triggered by a `checkpoint` in the plan.
    -   The `Editor` will compile a progress report.
    -   The `Board_Collective_Review` node will decide whether to `continue` or `adapt` the plan without user intervention.
-   \[ \] **Task 5: The User Guidance Escalation Path.**
    -   Implement the edge case where the Board of Experts determines it cannot proceed and must trigger a user interrupt for guidance.

#### Phase 18: Production-Grade Backend Infrastructure

_Goal: Evolve the backend from a prototype to a scalable, resilient, and persistent system._

-   \[ \] Task 1: Database Integration (SQLite & SQLAlchemy): Integrate a portable database for all state persistence.
-   \[ \] Task 2: Task Queue Integration (Dramatiq & Redis): Decouple the API from long-running agent jobs.

#### Phase 19: User Management & Authentication

_Goal: Transform the application into a secure, multi-user platform._

-   \[ \] Task 1: Authentication Service: Integrate a provider to handle logins.
-   \[ \] Task 2: Secure API Key Management: Build a system for users to store their own encrypted API keys.

#### Phase 20: Intelligent Agent Capabilities

_Goal: Enhance the core intelligence and capabilities of the agent itself._

-   \[ \] **Task 1: The Intelligent Blueprint System:** Implement the full blueprint architecture, including the `plan_expander_node`, to allow the agent to discover and use pre-defined multi-step plans as high-level tools.
-   \[ \] **Task 2: The "Committee of Critics":** Evolve the `critique_document` tool into the advanced multi-persona system we brainstormed, where a panel of AI experts collaborates to provide a comprehensive review.
-   \[ \] **Task 3: MCP Tool Integration:** Develop a wrapper to allow the agent to connect to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool ecosystem, dramatically expanding its available tools.
