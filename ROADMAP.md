### Project Vision:

To build a transformative, AI-powered workbench. The platform will be powerful enough for scientific research and general enough for power users, with a core architecture that allows users to easily add their own tools and capabilities. The system is designed for privacy and efficiency, with a clear path to running on local LLMs.

### âœ… COMPLETED: Phase 11: The Secure, Extensible Environment

-   \[x\] **Result:** The agent now operates with a robust, "commit-on-write" Memory Vault for persistent, structured knowledge. Each task is now automatically provisioned with its own isolated Python virtual environment, and the agent is equipped with a secure `pip_install` tool to manage dependencies on a per-task basis.

### ðŸš€ UPCOMING PHASES ðŸš€

#### Phase 12: The Interactive Workbench

_Goal: Evolve the workspace from a simple file list into a full-featured, interactive file explorer, enabling complex project management and a seamless user experience._

-   \[ \] **Sub-Phase A: The Smart Backend API:** Refactor the backend API to provide structured information about workspace items (e.g., name, type, size) and add new endpoints for creating, deleting, and renaming files and folders.
-   \[ \] **Sub-Phase B: The Navigable UI:** Upgrade the frontend to consume the new API, introducing folder navigation, breadcrumbs, and distinct icons for different file and folder types.
-   \[ \] **Sub-Phase C: Core Interactivity:** Implement essential user interactions, including a "New Folder" button and a right-click context menu for "Rename" and "Delete" actions.
-   \[ \] **Sub-Phase D: Advanced Features & Previews:** Add drag-and-drop file uploads and build a smart previewer capable of rendering various file types (images, Markdown, CSVs, source code) directly within the UI.

#### Phase 13: The "Tool Forge" - A Pluggable Tool Architecture

_Goal: Allow users to create and add their own tools to the ResearchAgent without writing any backend code._

-   \[ \] **Tool Creator UI:** Build a "Tool Forge" section in the UI where users can define a tool's name, description, and input arguments via a simple form.
-   \[ \] **Dynamic Tool Generation:** The backend will take the user's definition and dynamically generate the corresponding Python tool file, making it instantly available to the agent.
-   \[ \] **Async Job Queue:** Implement a background task queue to handle tools marked as "long-running." The UI will poll for status updates, allowing users to track progress and get results without locking up the interface.

#### Phase 14: Advanced Tooling & Templates

_Goal: Equip the agent with a suite of powerful, pre-built tools for common high-value tasks._

-   \[ \] **Multi-Document Reporter Tool:** A tool that can synthesize information from multiple text files or PDFs.
-   \[ \] **Scientific Data Fetcher Tool:** A specialized tool to find and download datasets from sources like NCBI, PubMed, etc.
-   \[ \] **Website Report Generator:** A tool that can populate pre-defined website templates with data to create visual reports.
