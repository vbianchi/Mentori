# ResearchAgent: Project Roadmap (v2.5.3 Target Base)

This document outlines the planned development path for the ResearchAgent project. It is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.

## Guiding Principles for Development

-   Accuracy & Reliability Over Speed
-   User-in-the-Loop (UITL/HITL)
-   Modularity & Maintainability
-   Extensibility

## Phase 1: Core Stability & Foundational Tools (Largely Complete - Basis of v2.5.2)

-   UI Framework: Three-panel layout.
-   Backend Infrastructure: Python, WebSockets, `aiohttp`.
-   Task Management: Persistent storage, UI updates.
-   Core Agent Flow (P-C-E-E Pipeline).
-   Core Tools Implemented & Refined.
-   LLM Configuration.
-   Frontend & Backend Refactoring.
-   Backend Plan Proposal Mechanism.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Agent Capabilities & User Experience (Current & Near-Term Focus - Targeting v2.5.3)

1.  Core Agent Execution Stability & Feature Verification (Improved)
    -   `deep_research_synthesizer` & `write_file` Flow: Actual execution logic in place.
    -   `UnboundLocalError` in `callbacks.py`: **FIXED.**
2.  Refine Chat UI/UX & Message Flow (Partially Implemented - Debugging in Progress)
    -   **Visual Design Goal (Achieved):** Implemented the chat interface as per `simulation_option6.html` (unified blue outer lines, no line on major steps, nested/indented component-specific lines for sub-statuses & thoughts, user message right line, persistent bottom thinking line). HTML tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`) now render correctly.
    -   **Persistence (Implemented):** All new message structures (major steps, sub-statuses, thoughts) are saved to and reloaded from the database.
    -   **Current Bugs & Next Steps for Chat UI/UX:**
        -   **FIX (Medium Priority): Token Counter Per Agent:** Ensure UI token counter updates correctly the token generated by each individual agent (INTENT CLASSIFIER, PLANNER, CONTROLLER, EXECUTOR, EVALUATOR).
        -   **FIX (Medium Priority): Artifact Viewer Refresh:** Ensure reliable auto-update after task completion.
        -   **FIX (Low Priority): Plan File Status Update:** Correct regex for updating checkboxes in `_plan_{id}.md`.
        -   **REVIEW (Low Priority): "Unknown" History Message Types:** Confirm monitor log is the correct destination.
3.  BUG FIX (Previously Medium Priority - Now covered by specific items above): Chat Input Unresponsive. (Likely related to New Task Connection/Agent State).
4.  DEBUG (Previously Medium Priority - Now Low): Monitor Log Color-Coding.
    -   Goal: Visually differentiate Monitor Log messages by source.
    -   PENDING/DEBUG: CSS rules in `style.css` need to be created/verified.

## Phase 3: Advanced Interactivity & Tooling (Mid-Term)

(No changes to this section's general goals yet)

-   Advanced User-in-the-Loop (UITL/HITL) Capabilities.
-   New Tools & Tool Enhancements.
-   Workspace RAG.
-   Improved Agent Memory & Context Management.

## Phase 4: Advanced Agent Autonomy & Specialized Applications (Longer-Term)

(No changes to this section's general goals yet)

-   Advanced Re-planning & Self-Correction.
-   User Permissions & Resource Gateway.
-   Streaming Output.
-   Specialized Agent Personas & Workflows.
-   Collaborative Features.

This roadmap will guide our development efforts. Feedback and adjustments are welcome.
