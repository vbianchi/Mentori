# ResearchAgent: Project Roadmap (v2.5.3 Target Base)

This document outlines the planned development path for the ResearchAgent project. It is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.

## Guiding Principles for Development

-   Accuracy & Reliability Over Speed
-   User-in-the-Loop (UITL/HITL)
-   Modularity & Maintainability
-   Extensibility

## Phase 1: Core Stability & Foundational Tools (Largely Complete - Basis of v2.5.2)

-   UI Framework: Three-panel layout.
-   Backend Infrastructure: Python, WebSockets, `aiohttp`.
-   Task Management: Persistent storage, UI updates.
-   Core Agent Flow (P-C-E-E Pipeline).
-   Core Tools Implemented & Refined.
-   LLM Configuration.
-   Frontend & Backend Refactoring.
-   Backend Plan Proposal Mechanism.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Agent Capabilities & User Experience (Current & Near-Term Focus - Targeting v2.5.3)

1.  Core Agent Execution Stability & Feature Verification (Improved)
    -   `deep_research_synthesizer` & `write_file` Flow: Actual execution logic in place.
    -   `UnboundLocalError` in `callbacks.py`: **FIXED.**
2.  Refine Chat UI/UX & Message Flow (Ongoing Enhancements & Fixes)
    -   **Visual Design Goal (Achieved):** Implemented the chat interface as per `simulation_option6.html`. HTML tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`) now render correctly.
    -   **Persistence (Implemented):** All new message structures (major steps, sub-statuses, thoughts) are saved to and reloaded from the database.
    -   **Key Features & Bug Fixes:**
        -   **FIXED: Token Counter Per Agent:** UI token counter now updates correctly with tokens generated by each individual agent.
        -   **FIXED: File Upload:** File upload functionality to task workspaces is now operational.
        -   **NEW FEATURE FOCUS: Enhanced In-Chat Tool Feedback & Usability:**
            -   Display tool action confirmations (e.g., for file writes) and output snippets (e.g., for file reads, search results) directly in chat using new message types and UI elements.
            -   Implement collapsible sections for longer tool outputs in chat.
            -   Add "Copy to Clipboard" functionality for relevant chat messages (thoughts, tool outputs, code blocks).
            -   Refine Planner prompting to ensure agents provide comprehensive final summary messages.
        -   **FIX (Medium Priority - Debugging Paused): Artifact Viewer Refresh:** Ensure reliable auto-update after task completion.
        -   **FIX (Low Priority): Plan File Status Update:** Correct regex for updating checkboxes in `_plan_{id}.md`.
        -   **REVIEW (Low Priority): "Unknown" History Message Types:** Confirm monitor log is the correct destination.
3.  DEBUG (Previously Medium Priority - Now Low): Monitor Log Color-Coding.
    -   Goal: Visually differentiate Monitor Log messages by source.
    -   PENDING/DEBUG: CSS rules in `style.css` need to be created/verified.

## Phase 3: Advanced Interactivity & Tooling (Mid-Term)

(No changes to this section's general goals yet)

-   Advanced User-in-the-Loop (UITL/HITL) Capabilities.
-   New Tools & Tool Enhancements.
-   Workspace RAG.
-   Improved Agent Memory & Context Management.

## Phase 4: Advanced Agent Autonomy & Specialized Applications (Longer-Term)

(No changes to this section's general goals yet)

-   Advanced Re-planning & Self-Correction.
-   User Permissions & Resource Gateway.
-   Streaming Output.
-   Specialized Agent Personas & Workflows.
-   Collaborative Features.

This roadmap will guide our development efforts. Feedback and adjustments are welcome.
