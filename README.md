# Manus AI UI Clone

A basic frontend structure replicating the UI layout of the Manus AI agent system based on a provided screenshot.

## Structure

-   `index.html`: Main HTML file
-   `css/style.css`: CSS for layout and styling
-   `js/script.js`: Placeholder for JavaScript interactivity

## Goal

To create a three-column layout:
1.  Left Panel: Task History/Navigation
2.  Center Panel: Chat Interaction
3.  Right Panel: Agent Activity Monitor (e.g., terminal output)

Built using HTML, CSS (Flexbox), and vanilla JavaScript (initially). Managed with Git.
